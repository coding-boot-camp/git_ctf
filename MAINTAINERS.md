# Maintainers

This file lists how the Operation Code Back End project is maintained. When making changes to the system, this file tells you who needs to review your contribution - you need a simple majority of maintainers for the relevant subsystems to provide a üëç on your pull request. Additionally, you need to not receive a veto from a lieutenant or the project lead.

Check out [how Operation Code Open Source projects are maintained](https://github.com/OperationCode/START_HERE/blob/master/open_source_maintenance_policy.md) for details on the process, how to become a maintainer, lieutenant, or the project lead.

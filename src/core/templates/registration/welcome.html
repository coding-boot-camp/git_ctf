<p>
    Welcome to Operation Code!<br/>
</p>

<p>
    Be on the lookout for an email invite to the <a href="https://operation-code.slack.com">Operation Code Slack
    community</a>. Slack is where we communicate online in real-time to ask questions, collaborate, and share
    information. It's a pivotal aspect of our community! If you've never used Slack before, consider watching this <a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RJZMSsH7-g">instructional video</a> on using the application. <br/>
</p>

<p>
    You've just joined a community of 5000+ software developers, veterans, and military spouses, who are all looking to
    further their skills and careers in tech! We are a decentralized organization, and we work both online (via Slack)
    and in <a href="https://www.meetup.com/pro/operationcode/">local chapters across the country.</a> We highly
    recommend giving yourself an introduction in the #general channel on Slack, and to sign up to go to your next local
    meetup! An example could be: <br/>
    "Hi all. My name is David. I'm from Washington and I'm interested in web development!"
    Please read our <a href="http://op.co.de/code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</a>, as well.
</p>

<p>
    Are you interested in helping Operation Code's website through code or design, and building your experience and
    portfolio? We're open source and love onboarding new developers! <a
        href="https://github.com/OperationCode/START_HERE">Read more here</a>, and join the #oc-projects channel on
    Slack - feel free to ask about anything.
</p>

<p>Again, welcome aboard, and don't forget to follow and share Operation Code on <a
        href="https://twitter.com/operation_code">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://facebook.com/operationcode.org">Facebook</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Cheers, and keep coding,<br/>

Welcome to Operation Code!

Be on the lookout for an email invite to the Operation Code Slack
community. Slack is where we communicate online in real-time to ask questions, collaborate, and share
information. It's a pivotal aspect of our community! If you've never used Slack before, consider watching this
instructional video on using the application.


You've just joined a community of 5000+ software developers, veterans, and military spouses, who are all looking to
further their skills and careers in tech! We are a decentralized organization, and we work both online (via Slack)
and in local chapters across the country. We highly
recommend giving yourself an introduction in the #general channel on Slack, and to sign up to go to your next local
meetup! An example could be:
    "Hi all. My name is David. I'm from Washington and I'm interested in web development!"
Please read our Code of Conduct, as well.


Are you interested in helping Operation Code's website through code or design, and building your experience and
portfolio? We're open source and love onboarding new developers!
Read more here, and join the #oc-projects channel on Slack - feel free to ask about anything.


Again, welcome aboard, and don't forget to follow and share Operation Code on Twitter and Facebook.


Cheers, and keep coding,
    the Operation Code team :)

P.S. - If you do not receive an invite from Slack within 24 hours, please email our support team, or ping us on Twitter at @operation_code.
